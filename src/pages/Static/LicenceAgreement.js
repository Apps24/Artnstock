Artnstock reserves the right to modify the TOS at any time in its sole discretion. Prior to such changes becoming effective, Artnstock will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such change. Such notice may be made by email to the email address on file in your Artnstock account, an announcement on this page, your login page, and/or by other means.

          <p className="text-style-4">arbitration administered under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association or of the International Centre for<br />Dispute Resolution in effect on the date of the commencement of arbitration, rather than in court, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets. The place of arbitration shall be the state and county of New York. The language of the arbitration shall be English. There shall be one arbitrator to be mutually agreed by the parties. Each party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration.

You and Artnstock acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable disputes under this TOS.</p>
