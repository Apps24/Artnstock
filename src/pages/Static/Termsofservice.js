          <p><span className="text-style">Terms of Service</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />Last Updated Date: July 5, 2022<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-3">Introduction</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />Artnstock Private Limited, provides a service for viewing, selling and purchasing original works of art and commercially exploiting digital images of works of art through our website, accessible at www.artnstock.com (the “Site”) or mobile application (the “Mobile Application”) together with any services, software, tools, features or functionality made available by Artnstock (each, a “Service” and collectively, the “Services”). Please read carefully the following terms and conditions (“Terms”) and our Privacy Policy, which may be found at www.artnstock.com/privacy (the “Privacy Policy”). These Terms, the Privacy Policy, and any other policies linked to herein, govern your access to and use of the Services, and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Artnstock.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />Certain areas of the Services and your access to certain Services may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and the terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Services or for access to specific Services, the latter terms and conditions shall take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Services.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-4">PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN PROCEED IN COURT. IF YOU WANT TO OPT-OUT OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU MAY DO SO PROVIDED YOU FOLLOW THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH BELOW IN THE SECTION ENTITLED “AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE”. THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION ALSO INCLUDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO PROCEED WITH ANY DISPUTE INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A PROPOSED CLASS. THESE TERMS ALSO INCLUDE A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE YOUR CLAIMS.</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES OR BY SELLING OR PURCHASING A WORK ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES OR BY POSTING ANY CONTENT ON THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND THE PRIVACY POLICY, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />If you accept or agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-3">Modifications to these Terms</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />Artnstock reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate the Services or to modify these Terms, at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Services or provide you with notice of the modification. We will also update the “Last Updated Date”. By continuing to access or use the Services after we have posted a modification on the Services or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services. We encourage you to check back regularly to review these Terms.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-3">Modifications to the Services</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />We reserve the right to change the URL, modify or discontinue, and restrict or block access to, the Services without notice to you. We may modify or remove any Original Works of Art (as defined below), Digital Works (as defined below), Artnstock Content (as defined below) or Member Content (as defined below) from the Services at any time without notice to you, including the removal of any works of art or content that we believe to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />Occasionally, there may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or update information if any such information on the Services is inaccurate at any time without prior notice. We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the Services, except as required by applicable local, state, federal or international laws, regulations, or statutes. No specified update or refresh date applied to the Services should be taken to indicate that all information on the Services has been modified or updated.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-3">Eligibility</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />The Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 or older. Any access to or use of the Services by anyone under 18 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Services you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-3">Account Registration</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />In order to list a work on the Services or to make a purchase through the Services or writing any comments in forums or reviews, (other than users who utilize the guest checkout option), you must first create an account (“Account”) by completing our registration process. During the registration process you will be required to provide certain information and you will establish a username and a password. Upon completion of our registration process or by utilizing our guest checkout option you will become a “Member.” You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete, for example if you become VAT registered.

Third-party platforms through which you access the Site may collect information related to your use of such third-party platform and make such information available to Artnstock subject to your agreement with the applicable third-party platform.

The above licenses will continue unless and until you remove Your Content from the Site, in which case the licenses will terminate within a commercially reasonable period of time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the license for legal archival/preservation purposes will continue indefinitely.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-4">You may not upload, post, or transmit any video, image, text, audio recording, or other content that:</span><br /><span className="text-style-5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;Infringes any third party's copyrights or other intellectual property rights or any right of publicity or privacy;</span><br />• &nbsp;&nbsp;Contains any pornographic, defamatory, or otherwise unlawful or immoral content.<br />• &nbsp;&nbsp;Exploits minors;<br />• &nbsp;&nbsp;Depicts unlawful or violent acts;<br />• &nbsp;&nbsp;Depicts animal cruelty or violence towards animals;<br />• &nbsp;&nbsp;Promotes fraudulent schemes or gives rise to a claim of deceptive advertising or unfair competition; or<br />• &nbsp;&nbsp;Violates any law, statute, or regulation.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />You may not use any Artnstock Content for any purpose without first obtaining a license to use such Artnstock Content. Any use of Artnstock Content by you shall be governed by the applicable license agreement separately entered into between you and Artnstock. Displaying and/or distributing to the public any watermarked or unlicensed Artnstock Content (whether incorporated into a derivative work or alone) constitutes copyright infringement.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-3">Buying and Selling Products</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />If you buy something, we kindly require you to pay for it. In order to send these items to you, we will ask for some personal payment and shipping information—we have to because you’re going to want the thing you just bought, right? In rare cases, something may not be available and we will inform you of that promptly.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-6">Orders</span><br />All products are subject to availability and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order, to reject all or part of an order, and to discontinue products without notice, even if you have already placed your order. Your placement of an order as a customer does not necessarily assure that we will accept your order. We reserve the right to refuse any order in our sole discretion. In addition, before accepting your order, we may require additional information if you have not provided all the information required by us to complete your order.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />Generally, use of the Services is limited to orders for your personal use. However, if you are interested in buying large quantities of products, please contact our team.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-6">Payments</span><br />If products or services are made available for purchase through the Services and you wish to purchase the products or services, you may be asked by us or our designee (or, if the products or services are being made available by a third party provider, by the third party provider) to supply certain information relevant to your purchase, including, without limitation, credit card number, expiration date, billing address and shipping information.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT MEANS USED BY YOU OR THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT TO PURCHASE ANY PRODUCT AND/OR SERVICE.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />You acknowledge that any such information will be treated by us in accordance with our Privacy Policy. You grant us the right to provide such information to third parties in order to facilitate the completion of transactions initiated by you or on your behalf through the Services. Verification of information may be required prior to acceptance of any order through the Services.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-6">Taxes and Shipping</span><br />Applicable taxes will be shown during the checkout process prior to finalizing your order. If applicable, VAT is included in the purchase price. Shipping charges will be shown during the checkout process prior to finalizing your order. Shipping charges include the rate we are charged by third parties for sending your order, plus a reasonable amount for packaging and handling. Title to products passes to you upon shipment. We endeavor to deliver all orders on-schedule. However, we cannot guarantee that our shipping providers or suppliers will not experience any shipping delays or problems.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-6">Errors, Inaccuracies and Omissions</span><br />On rare occasions, you might find that the product you receive does not match what you saw online. If that occurs, let us know.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />We strive to be as accurate as possible. However, we do not warrant that all product descriptions, images, photographs, pricing or other information on the Services are accurate, complete, current, or error-free. In addition, all weights and size dimensions are approximate. If a product offered by us is not as described or pictured, your sole remedy is to return it in an unused condition for a refund in accordance with our Return, Exchange and Refund policies below. In the event of an error, whether on the Services, in an order confirmation, in processing an order, in delivering a product or otherwise, we reserve the right to correct any error and revise your order accordingly, or to cancel the order and refund any amount charged. IF YOU RECEIVE AN ORDER THAT YOU BELIEVE CONTAINS A MISTAKE, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTACT US RIGHT AWAY SO THAT WE MAY CORRECT THE ERROR.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-6">Return, Exchange and Refund Policies</span><br />As much as we’d like to, we can’t always guarantee your happiness with a product. To address this, we have a return policy.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />Click here for the details of our return, exchange, and refund policies. We comply with the applicable laws and regulations with respect to returns, exchanges and refunds in your jurisdiction.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-6">Artist Share</span><br />We pay artists for products sold with their original artwork—that’s basically the key point of our business. However, if you violate these Terms or any of our policies, and your account is suspended, you will not receive any pending payments.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />For every product that is sold with your artwork printed on it, we will pay you (“Artist Share”), based on the schedule set forth here. For sales of products on society6.com and its international websites, you will be paid on a monthly basis, generally within thirty (30) days of the end of a month. For sales of products through our third party affiliates, wholesale partners or third party retailers, you will be paid within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter. Unless otherwise stated or agreed upon in writing, all amounts will be paid in U.S. Dollars. You are responsible for paying all applicable taxes associated with your receipt of Artist Share. Please see our Seller’s Guide for more information.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />IN THE EVENT THAT YOUR ACCOUNT IS SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED DUE TO YOUR VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS OR OUR POLICIES AS DETERMINED BY US IN OUR REASONABLE DISCRETION, YOU WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANY UNPAID ARTIST SHARE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE REIMBURSEMENT OF ANY ARTIST SHARE PAID TO YOU WHILE YOU WERE IN BREACH OF THESE TERMS OR OUR POLICIES.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />If you believe that any Artist Share has been erroneously withheld from you or that your account has been erroneously or unfairly suspended or terminated, please contact us so we may further investigate. If you are still unsatisfied or feel that you have not been treated fairly, please see the section below for Resolution of Disputes.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-3">Accounts</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />You can’t sell artwork on the Services without creating an account. Please do so accurately and responsibly.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-6">Registration and Account Information</span><br />In order for you to include your artwork on products sold through the Services, you must create an account. When creating an account, you must provide accurate, complete and updated registration and contact information. In addition, you must update your account information to keep it current and complete at all times. We may from time to time require you to provide additional information confirming your identity, including government identification, payment information, and tax identification and/or withholding forms. You may not create more than one (1) account without our prior written approval and only if you have a good reason.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />You are solely responsible for all the activity that occurs through your account, including the activities of others and regardless of whether the activities are authorized, and for keeping your account password secure. You agree to notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although we will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for our losses or the losses of others due to any unauthorized use. We reserve the right to require you to alter your password if we have reason to believe your password is no longer secure. We may also require you to change your password from time to time.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />You may not select a user name that is vulgar, offensive, obscene or attempts to impersonate another person. You may never use another person’s account. We reserve the right to refuse to provide you with an account or cancel your account in our sole discretion, provided that such termination will not terminate our obligation to make any payments to you that may be owed.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-6">Disclosure of Account Information</span><br />Under certain circumstances, we may disclose your account information.<br />You acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain and disclose your account information, artwork and content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that any access, retention or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) enforce these Terms or the policies; (b) respond to your requests for customer service; (c) respond to a legal notice; (d) comply with legal process; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of our company, our users or the public.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-6">Termination of Account</span><br />We don’t like to say it but—we or you can terminate our relationship at any time. We will terminate your account if you violate these Terms or our policies. (We’re desperately trying not to make a Terminator reference. Our lawyers say it’s not advisable.)<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />• &nbsp;&nbsp;We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services if you are determined to be, in our sole discretion, in violation of these Terms</p>
          <p className="text-style-7">or any of our policies. We may also suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Services or your account at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately.</p>
          <p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;You may terminate these Terms at any time by terminating your use of the Services.<br />• &nbsp;&nbsp;On termination of these Terms for any reason, the rights and licenses granted to you hereunder will immediately terminate and</p>
          <p className="text-style-7">the provisions of these Terms that by their nature and context are intended to survive termination will survive. We will have no liability to you for any damages, loss of profits or other claims arising from the termination or suspension of your access to the Services or your account.</p>
          <p><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />Upon termination we will suspend your account and remove your artwork, if any, from the Services within ninety (90) days. Without limitation of the foregoing, we will have the right to retain copies of your account information, artwork and content in our archives for our internal business and legal purposes. Unless your account has been terminated for a breach of these Terms or any of our policies, as determined by us in our reasonable discretion, you will be paid, in the ordinary course, any Artist Share owed to you through the termination of your account.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />If you believe that your account has been erroneously or unfairly suspended or terminated, please contact us so we may further investigate. If you are still unsatisfied or feel that you have not been treated fairly, please see the section below for Resolution of Disputes.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-3">Infringement Claims/DMCA Notices</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br />If you believe that any Image or other material made available by Artnstock infringes upon any copyright that you own or control, you may notify Artnstock in the manner set forth in our DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice Policy.<br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-3">Limitations</span><br /><span className="text-style-2">&nbsp;</span><br /><span className="text-style-4">You agree that you shall not:</span><br /><span className="text-style-5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;Engage in any conduct that shall constitute a violation of any law or that infringes the rights of Artnstock or any third party.</span><br />• &nbsp;&nbsp;Violate any applicable laws or regulations related to the access to or use of the Site, or engage in any activity prohibited by these Terms</p>
          <p className="text-style-7">of Use.</p>
          <p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;Violate the rights of Artnstock or any third party (including rights of privacy and publicity) or abuse, defame, harass, stalk or threaten</p>
